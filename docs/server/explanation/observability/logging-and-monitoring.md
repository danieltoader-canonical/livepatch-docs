# Logging and Monitoring

Monitoring of the Livepatch server can be most easily done by setting up monitoring on one or more endpoints. Livepatch server exposes two endpoints, in particular, `/debug/info` and `/debug/status`, that provide information on the server’s version and the server’s database/related services, respectively. Any monitoring solution can periodically check `/debug/info` as a liveliness check to ensure the service is running.

The on-prem server also exposes Prometheus text-based formatted metrics available from a /metrics endpoint which can be used to monitor the system.

When deploying with Juju, debug logs from all deployed applications can be obtained with the command `juju debug-logs`. Increasing the server’s log level can be configured with `juju config livepatch log_level=<level>` A full list of log levels are available on the Configure logging and monitoring [page](/server/how-to-guides/operations/configure-logging-and-monitoring.md#configure-the-log-level).

Further information on the use of juju for logging can be obtained from Juju’s [documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/juju-cli/list-of-juju-cli-commands/debug-log/).

## Security logging

For detailed guidance on configuring security event logging, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, log redaction, and centralized log forwarding, see [How to configure logging and monitoring](/server/how-to-guides/operations/configure-logging-and-monitoring.md).
