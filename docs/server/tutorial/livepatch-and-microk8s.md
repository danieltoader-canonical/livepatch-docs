# Getting started with Livepatch On-Prem and Microk8s

## Introduction

Livepatch on-prem is a self-hosted version of the Livepatch server, enabling the delivery of patches to machines within network restricted environments.

This tutorial will deploy the Livepatch On-prem server as a Kubernetes application. We will deploy and configure the livepatch on-prem server using Juju and Charmed Operators. Juju is an Open Source Charmed Operator Framework that controls the whole lifecycle of an application. While this is one option for deploying the on-prem server, another is to deploy to virtual machines as described [here](/server/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-via-juju.md).

For this tutorial we will use Microk8s, a lightweight tool for creating a local Kubernetes cluster.

You don’t need to have previous or advanced knowledge of Juju or Charmed Operators to follow this guide and deploy livepatch.

### Livepatch authorization token

Since on-prem livepatch servers act as caching proxies for the livepatch service hosted by Canonical, a subscription token is required to authorise the on-prem instance to pull patch information.

To get your Ubuntu Pro subscription token, please go to https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard, login to your Ubuntu SSO account and use your free personal token for the remainder of this guide.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. (Optional) Setup Multipass environment

Multipass is a CLI tool to launch Ubuntu VMs from Windows, Linux and MacOS. The remainder of this guide can be run from within a multipass VM to avoid affecting the host machine.

Start by running the following commands to install and start a Multipass VM, the optional section will define the VM’s memory/cpu/disk usage.

```
sudo snap install multipass
multipass launch jammy --name livepatch-deploy [-m 12g -c 4 -d 40G]
multipass shell livepatch-deploy
```

### 2. Initialize Juju and microk8s

Now we can install our dependencies, note that Juju 3.1 only works with a strictly confined microk8s Snap.

```
 sudo snap install microk8s --channel=1.25-strict/stable
 sudo snap install juju --channel=3.1/stable
```

Once you have the Juju CLI installed, you will need to bootstrap a Juju controller to your cloud (microk8s in this case). The [Juju documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/tutorial/) has detailed instructions on how to do that for several clouds and machine types.

To begin,

```
# Add the 'ubuntu' user to the MicroK8s group:
sudo usermod -a -G snap_microk8s ubuntu
# Give the 'ubuntu' user permissions to read the ~/.kube directory:
sudo chown -f -R ubuntu ~/.kube
# Create the 'microk8s' group:
newgrp snap_microk8s
# Enable the necessary MicroK8s addons:
sudo microk8s enable hostpath-storage dns ingress
# Set up a short alias for the Kubernetes CLI:
sudo snap alias microk8s.kubectl kubectl
```

Next,

```
# Since the Juju package is strictly confined, you also need to manually create a path:
mkdir -p ~/.local/share
juju bootstrap microk8s livepatch-demo-controller
juju add-model livepatch
```

### 3. Deploying the bundle

The bundle and charmed operators necessary to deploy livepatch server are available in the charmstore using the “k8s” track at

https://charmhub.io/canonical-livepatch-onprem

Livepatch On-Prem needs a place to store patches that it syncs from the upstream. By default the above "k8s" bundle will store patches in PostgreSQL directly. Other options including S3 storage are available and can be configured as described [here](/server/reference/patch-storage/index.md).

In order to ensure PostgreSQL has enough space, see our [resources topic](/server/reference/platform/resource-requirements.md) for requirements on virtual machines running livepatch on-prem. Although this information relates to the deployment of Livepatch on virtual machines, the storage requirements remain similar.

To start the deployment within the previously created juju model, run:

```
juju deploy canonical-livepatch-onprem --channel=k8s/stable --trust
```

### 4. Configuring livepatch

After the deployment completes, verify the status of the model by running:

```
juju status
```

The output should look like the following while the applications are initialising:

![|624x116](/_static/images/ym7r1pLvMBXCDSGgcVARsFDG3w9Po4z.png)

After initialisation, the livepatch unit is expected to be in a blocked state with the message:

`"✘ patch-sync token not set, run get-resource-token action"`

Provide the token (acquired by following instructions in the Livepatch authorization token section) by running:

```
juju run livepatch/leader get-resource-token contract-token=<token> --wait 30s
```

The output should indicate the token has successfully been acquired:

![|624x61](/_static/images/kdKRpt7Vxhsz1JKCNYoMEC9UjXj.png)

After that, provide the url_template setting as follows:

```
juju config livepatch server.url-template="http://10.1.236.9:8080/v1/patches/{filename}"
```

The url_template specifies the url where patch files can be downloaded by livepatch clients. The url template should be of the form 'http(s)://{HOSTNAME}/v1/patches/{filename}'. The hostname is the only part that needs to be changed. When using microk8s, all pods and services are exposed by default to the host so the hostname simplifies to the ip address of the livepatch-server unit (this is the pod’s IP address). This is useful for testing but not helpful in a production setup. You should now be able to curl the Livepatch pod with

```
curl 10.1.236.9:8080
Canonical Livepatch Health service, version v1.13.1
```

To take this a step further we can configure the `service-hostname` config option of the nginx-ingress-integrator charm which will then set up an ingress in the microk8s cluster. That can be tested as follows,

```
juju config ingress service-hostname=livepatch.test.com
kubectl get ingress -n livepatch
NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE
livepatch-test-com-ingress public livepatch.test.com 127.0.0.1 80 2m14s
# Next we will edit our hosts file to make this address reachable locally
echo '127.0.0.1 livepatch.test.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
curl livepatch.test.com
Canonical Livepatch Health service, version v1.13.1
```

Follow up on this by changing the url-template to match the ingress with

```
juju config livepatch server.url-template="http://livepatch.test.com/v1/patches/{filename}"
```

To run this in a production environment, you will need to expose this microk8s cluster publicly.

#### Deploying with a config overlay (Optional)

These settings can be configured at deploy-time by using a juju bundle overlay:

```
juju deploy ch:canonical-livepatch-onprem –channel=k8s/stable --overlay config.yaml
```

The overlay file should have the following content:

```
applications:
  livepatch:
    options:
      url_template: <patch url template>
      external_hostname: <your-desired-hostname>
```

### 5. Setting up authentication

To enable admin tool access to the livepatch server, authentication needs to be configured. This is done with username/password authentication.

Generate the password hash using:

```
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
htpasswd -bnBC 10 <username> <password>
username:$2y$10$74ZpDgHaxnUQo.AJZk1cMuSRfef5oK5xq5o/GLbUH/Bbw6W2bmctm
```

The above is a `username:<hashed-password>` pair that was generated from the pair “username:password” exactly. This should be changed for a production workload.

Use the output of the previous command to configure livepatch:

```
juju config livepatch auth.basic.enabled=true
juju config livepatch auth.basic.users='username:$2y$10$74ZgHaxn...UH/Bbw6W2bmctm'
```

See [Administration Tool](/server/how-to-guides/security/setup-administration-tool.md) topic for instructions on installing the administration tool and setting up authentication.

Once this has been done, the livepatch admin tool can be used to authenticate:

```
export LIVEPATCH_URL=http(s)://{pod or ingress url}
livepatch-admin login -a username:password
```

### 6. Downloading patches

The final step before attaching client machines to the server is to download patches from Canonical servers. This can be done using the admin tool. See [How to setup administration tool](/server/how-to-guides/security/setup-administration-tool.md) for installation steps.

To download patches, run:

```
 livepatch-admin sync trigger --wait
```

To check for synced patches run:

```
livepatch-admin storage patches
```

And to check for any sync failures run:

```
livepatch-admin sync report
```

To limit which patches are downloaded see this [document](/server/reference/patch-management/patch-sync-filters.md).

## Enabling machine status reporting

Each livepatch on-prem instance can optionally send information about the status of the machines it's serving back to Canonical. This functionality is opt-in.

The information sent back about each machine includes:

- Kernel version
- CPU model
- Architecture
- Boot time and uptime
- Livepatch client version
- Obfuscated machine id
- Status of the patch currently applied to the machine's kernel

To enable this reporting, run the following juju command:

```
juju config livepatch patch-sync.send-machine-reports=true
```

This can be disabled at any time by setting the flag to `false`.

### 7. Cleaning up

To clean up your Juju model you can run the following:

```
juju destroy-model --no-prompt livepatch --destroy-storage
```

And to cleanup the Multipass VM:

```
multipass delete --purge livepatch-deploy
```
