# Patch Sync Filters

Livepatch on-prem enables users to synchronise with the hosted server, and this synchronisation process is configurable.

The primary synchronisation filters are:

- System architecture for limiting patches via architecture.
- Flavours for limiting the kernel flavour.
- Minimum kernel version, only allowing versions greater than the minimum to be synchronized.

Set sync filters if you want to reduce the amount of space consumed by Livepatch files and/or you know your client machines will be limited to a certain set of kernel variants.

A full list of the available sync filters can be found in our [config](/server/reference/platform/configuration.md).
