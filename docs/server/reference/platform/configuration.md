# Configuration

This document provides the configuration options for the Livepatch server.

```{note}
The configuration below applies to the Livepatch Server operator charms and Server snap. 
For our reactive charm (or if your deployment config doesn't match the below), please see [here](/server/how-to-guides/deployment/migrate-from-reactive-charm-to-operator-charm.md).
```

## Setting config

Depending on your deployment you may be using Juju + charms or a standalone Snap to deploy the Livepatch server. How you setup config will differ slightly between the two.

Default and example values are available on the respective [machine](https://charmhub.io/canonical-livepatch-server/configurations?channel=ops1.x/stable) and [K8s](https://charmhub.io/canonical-livepatch-server-k8s/configurations) charm config pages.

### Juju

The config values in the table below map directly to the config options exposed by the Livepatch charms (except where otherwise stated).

Assuming the Livepatch server has been deployed with the alias `livepatch`, to change a config value run:

```
juju config livepatch <key>=<value>
# E.g. to enable basic auth
juju config livepatch auth.basic.enabled=true
```

See the [Juju docs](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/juju-cli/list-of-juju-cli-commands/config/) for all the ways you can apply config.

### Snap

The config values in the table below map directly to the config values accepted by the Livepatch server snap. An additional value must be added to all commands as shown below.

To change a config value run:

```
sudo snap set canonical-livepatch-server lp.<key>=<value>
# E.g. to enable basic auth
sudo snap set canonical-livepatch-server lp.auth.basic.enabled=true
```
