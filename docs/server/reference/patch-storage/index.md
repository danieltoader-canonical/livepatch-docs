# Livepatch on-prem patch storage

Livepatch server supports several different drivers for storing patch files downloaded from livepatch.canonical.com:

1. Local filesystem
2. Swift
3. S3 (and compatible implementations, e.g. minio)
4. Postgresql

The filesystem patch store is easiest to deploy and suits most configurations. However, if there is a need to scale out the livepatch server such as have multiple livepatch servers running to handle the load, the filesystem patch store should not be used.

In case there is a need to scale out livepatch on-prem, use the s3, postgresql or swift patch stores. Any patch store should have enough space for storing livepatches - currently at least 45GB for all patches, see [this guide](/server/reference/patch-management/patch-sync-filters.md) to filter patches sent to your on-prem instance to specific kernel variants/architectures and lower this requirement.

See the [patch storage](/server/reference/platform/configuration.md) config for all available parameters.
