# How to use Livepatch client with an on-prem server

## Network access

Machines running livepatch-client will need network access to the on-prem server. HTTPS (:443) or HTTP (:80) is used, depending on how the livepatch on-prem haproxy and the livepatch application's url_template setting are configured.

In addition to that, machines will require access to the Canonical snap store to install the livepatch client snap:

- Snap Store: `api.snapcraft.io:443`
- Snap Store CDN: `*.snapcraftcontent.com:443`

## Generating the authorization token

To configure this livepatch client to start pulling patches from the on-prem livepatch server, an authorization token is necessary. To issue it, run:

```
livepatch-admin auth-token <id> <tier>
```

The tier parameter is one of the tiers available on the server. The client will download patches as they become available in that tier. See [this page](/server/reference/patch-management/patch-management.md) on how to manage tiers and patches in your on-prem server.

The id parameter bears no significance in an on-prem deployment. It can be set to a value identifying the group of livepatch clients that will be enabled using the same token (a single authorization token can be used to enable multiple client instances).

## Configuring livepatch client

To start applying livepatches to a machine, it is necessary to install the livepatch client on it. Livepatch client is currently distributed as a snap. On the machine run:

```
sudo snap install canonical-livepatch
```

Once the client is installed, it needs to be configured to pull patches from the on-prem server:

```
canonical-livepatch config remote-server="http(s)://<hostname>"
```

The authorization token returned can be then used to attach any number of machines to the on-prem livepatch server:

```
canonical-livepatch enable <token>
```
