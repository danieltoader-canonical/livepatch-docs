# Configure logging and monitoring for the Livepatch Server

The Livepatch Server provides structured security event logging and Prometheus metrics for monitoring. The following sections describe how to configure and consume these security-relevant features. For general monitoring concepts and debug endpoints, see the [Logging and Monitoring explanation](/server/explanation/observability/logging-and-monitoring.md).

(server-how-to-guides-configure-the-log-level)=

## Configure the log level

The server's log level controls the verbosity of output. Available levels are: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`.

For production deployments, use `info` or `warn` to capture security events without excessive noise.

### Snap

Set the log level through snap configuration:

```shell
sudo snap set canonical-livepatch-server log-level=info
```

### Charm

Set the log level through Juju configuration:

```shell
juju config canonical-livepatch-server-k8s server.log-level=info
```

## Security events

All security events are emitted to the standard logger output as structured JSON. Each event includes a `type: "security"` field for filtering. The following categories of security events are logged:

* **Authentication successes and failures** for all authentication methods (Basic Auth, Macaroons, machine tokens, resource tokens, sync tokens, webhook tokens)
* **Authorization failures** (tier mismatches, invalid affordances, unauthorized access attempts)
* **Token lifecycle events** (creation, deletion, and updates of authentication tokens)
* **Administrative activity** (all admin API requests with identity and endpoint information)
* **System events** (startup, shutdown, crash, and OS signal handling)

## Configure Prometheus monitoring

The server exposes metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format. Key security-relevant metrics include:

| Metric | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| `AuthDuration` | Time taken to authenticate requests, by token type |
| `AuthorizerCount` | Count of authentication attempts, by token type |
| `RequestOverloadCounter` | Requests dropped due to server overload |
| `RequestDuration` | HTTP request latency, by method, handler, and status code |
| `DatabaseErrorCount` | Total database errors |

Configure Prometheus to scrape the `/metrics` endpoint. For charm deployments, the charm provides a `metrics-endpoint` integration for Prometheus scraping and a `grafana-dashboard` integration that ships a pre-built Grafana dashboard:

```shell
juju integrate canonical-livepatch-server-k8s prometheus-k8s:metrics-endpoint
juju integrate canonical-livepatch-server-k8s grafana-k8s:grafana-dashboard
```

The Grafana dashboard includes panels for authentication timing by token type, 24-hour token usage counts, contracts service errors, and request throughput.

For centralized log collection, the charm supports forwarding logs to Loki:

```shell
## Juju >= 3.4 (direct log forwarding)
juju integrate canonical-livepatch-server-k8s loki-k8s:logging

## Juju < 3.4 (Promtail-based log proxy)
juju integrate canonical-livepatch-server-k8s loki-k8s:log-proxy
```

## Log structure

Log entries follow this structure:

```json
{
  "level": "warn",
  "ts": "2025-10-01T10:45:41.142Z",
  "caller": "httpauth/basic.go:26",
  "msg": "...",
  "type": "security",
  "appid": "server.admin_authn",
  "event": "basicauth_authn_failed:user_not_found",
  "description": "User not found",
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/v1/admin/auth-token",
  "trace-id": "39e28f24-..."
}
```

### Snap

Application logs are captured by systemd-journald. To view security logs:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u snap.canonical-livepatch-server.livepatch.service | grep '"type":"security"'
```

### Charm (Kubernetes)

Container logs are available through standard Kubernetes log collection:

```shell
kubectl logs -n <model-name> <livepatch-pod> | grep '"type":"security"'
```

The server also writes logs to `/var/log/livepatch` inside the container, with logrotate configured for daily rotation (three files retained, 10MB size trigger, compression enabled).

When integrated with Loki via the `logging` or `log-proxy` relations, logs are forwarded automatically and can be queried through Grafana.

## Charm log redaction

The charm (not the server binary) includes a log redaction module that scrubs sensitive data from charm operator logs. The following patterns are redacted before logs reach any handler:

* Database connection URIs with embedded credentials (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@host/db`)
* HTTP Authorization headers (`Bearer` and `Basic` tokens)
* Key-value pairs where the key implies a secret (e.g., `password=`, `token=`, `api-key=`, `credentials=`)
* Specific environment variables: `LP_CONTRACTS_PASSWORD`, `LP_PATCH_SYNC_TOKEN`, `LP_PATCH_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_KEY`, `LP_PATCH_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `LP_PATCH_STORAGE_SWIFT_API_KEY`, `LP_AUTH_BASIC_USERS`, `LP_AUTH_SSO_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LP_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`, and others

All redacted values are replaced with `***REDACTED***` in log output.

## Risks of disabling logging

Reducing the log level to `error` or `fatal` suppresses security event logs at the `info` and `warn` levels, which includes authentication successes, token lifecycle events, and administrative activity. This significantly reduces visibility into security-relevant operations and is not recommended for production deployments.
