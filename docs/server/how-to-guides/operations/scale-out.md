# How to scale out a Livepatch on-prem deployment

There are several possible scenarios where scaling out a livepatch deployment could be necessary:

1. High traffic due to large amount of machines being serviced
2. High availability setups

The livepatch on-prem deployment consists of 3 main components: the `haproxy` reverse-proxying requests, `postgresql` storing livepatch data and `livepatch server` itself. Any one (or all) of these components can be scaled out with additional units by running the `juju` command with the following syntax:

```
juju add-unit <component> -n <number of units>
```

Where `<component>` is `haproxy`, `postgresql` or `livepatch` and `<number of units>` is the number of additional units required.

## Scaling out haproxy

To deploy more than one ingress haproxy unit, run the following juju command:

```
juju add-unit haproxy -n 1
```

If more than one haproxy unit is being used, the DNS entry pointing to the livepatch server should contain links to all the haproxy units.

## Scaling out postgresql

Scaling out postgresql will deploy additional follower units that can take over in case the leader fails.

To deploy additional postgresql units, run the following juju command:

```
juju add-unit postgrseql -n 1
```

## Scaling out livepatch

Deploying additional livepatch units will let them share the load of handling machine requests. The filesystem patch storage type is not compatible with a scaled out livepatch setup.

To deploy additional livepatch units, run the following juju commands:

```
juju add-unit livepatch -n 1
```

## Get new resource tokens

Once the units have been added, an additional command will have to be run for each of the new units:

```
juju run-action livepatch/{i} get-resource-token
```

Replace `{i}` with the number of each new livepatch unit in the `juju status` output.
