# How to use the Canonical Livepatch Downloader

The Canonical Livepatch downloader tool is a CLI application that provides basic commands to query and download patch files.

Please note that this tool is not a replacement for the [Canonical Livepatch client](https://snapcraft.io/canonical-livepatch). Instead it provides some basic patch download and query functionality which may be particularly desirable in the following scenarios:

- If the Livepatch client cannot be used and patches must be inserted manually.
- To downloaded patches before transferring them into an airgapped on-premise deployment of the Livepatch Server.
- To download patch tarballs before moving them to the configured patch storage, in case a patch sync with the hosted Livepatch server cannot be performed.

## Using the Canonical Livepatch Downloader

### Setup the Downloader

Install the snap with

```
sudo snap install canonical-livepatch-downloader
```

Enable the tool by running the following command with an Ubuntu Pro token obtained from the [Ubuntu Pro dashboard](https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard), note that the token must be entitled to Livepatch and belong to the `stable` tier.

```
canonical-livepatch-downloader enable <token>
```

### Downloading single patches

For this section we will list and download patches for a specific kernel release. Using the host system's kernel and assuming an `amd64` architecture.

```
KERNEL_VERSION=$(cat /proc/version_signature  | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
canonical-livepatch-downloader list --kernel=$KERNEL_VERSION --architecture=amd64
```

A sample output for a specific kernel version is provided below:

```
canonical-livepatch-downloader list --kernel=5.15.0-107.117-generic --architecture=amd64
- filename: livepatch-5.15.0-107.117-generic-107.1-amd64.tar.bz2
  hash: 696070a5dfb927bc9dcec809f7ba81c059e981a02829b44253e8ecf84d829fb5
- filename: livepatch-5.15.0-107.117-generic-106.1-amd64.tar.bz2
  hash: 2b061466b553ca8805e7f278405031bf7607e088525dee5d21e19de513253df6
- filename: livepatch-5.15.0-107.117-generic-105.1-amd64.tar.bz2
  hash: a73e702c795d1670066ac7209912434ae02006dc97a81b2b4bbdfebfbd15b7db
- filename: livepatch-5.15.0-107.117-generic-104.1-amd64.tar.bz2
  hash: a603d9c7448d874625a95a2c06cbf554d3184868e803fb98b310a5722e9f359b
```

Next we will download the latest patch for your kernel.

```
canonical-livepatch-downloader get-latest --kernel=$KERNEL_VERSION --architecture=amd64
```

An example output is provided below

```
canonical-livepatch-downloader get-latest --kernel=5.15.0-107.117-generic --architecture=amd64
Downloading patch 1/1
Patch livepatch-5.15.0-107.117-generic-107.1-amd64 downloaded and extracted to /home/demo/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/patches/livepatch-5.15.0-107.117-generic-107.1-amd64
```

Note that the path the patch was downloaded to is shown. Unfortunately the downloaded file path cannot currently be changed due to [snap confinement](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement).

If a specific patch from the list is desired instead of the latest, use the `get-files` command as follows.

```
canonical-livepatch-downloader get-files livepatch-5.15.0-107.117-generic-105.1-amd64.tar.bz2
```

### Syncing groups of patches

Syncing a group of patches is useful when you want to manually transfer patches from into an airgapped environment.

To sync a group of patches we will utilise the `list` and `get-files` commands. Note that, again, because of snap confinement we must place the output of the `list` command in a location that the snap can access.

The list command provides filtering based on the following parameters:

- Architecture: Specify a fixed architecture string, e.g. "amd64" or "s390x"
- Flavour: Specify a kernel flavour, e.g. "generic", "lowlatency", etc.
- Kernel: A prefix match on kernel versions. E.g. 6.2 will match kernel versions 6.2.\*
- Tier: Specify the tier from which to download patches, defaults to "Proposed". See [here](/client/explanation/architecture/what-are-livepatch-tiers.md) for more info on tiers.

The same flag cannot be passed multiple times. If multiple kernel versions, flavours or architectures are desired, run the following commands with each combination.

Assuming that we want to sync all patches for architecture `amd64`, kernel `4.4.0-1100` and flavour `aws`:

```
canonical-livepatch-downloader list --architecture=amd64 --flavour=aws --kernel=4.4.0-1100  > ~/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/patch-list.txt
canonical-livepatch-downloader get-files -i ~/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/patch-list.txt
```

The output will indicate the download progress and specify the final download location:

```
24/24 patches downloaded successfully.
Patches downloaded and extracted to /home/demo/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/patches
```

### Saving the downloaded patch tarballs

The default behavior of the patch-downloader is to download the patch tarball served by the hosted Livepatch server to a temporary location, perform file checksum checks, extract the patch files from the tarball and then delete the downloaded patch tarball from the temporary location.

This behaviour can be overridden to save the downloaded patch tarballs in a permanent location for further use, by using the `-K` or `--keep-tarball` option with the `get-latest` or `get-files` commands. A potential use-case for doing this could be to move the patch tarballs to the configured on-prem patch storage, when a patch sync with the hosted Livepatch server cannot be performed.

For example, if we want to store the downloaded patch tarballs and the extracted patch files for the architecture `amd64`, kernel `5.15.0-25` and flavour `generic`:

```
canonical-livepatch-downloader list --kernel 5.15.0-25 --architecture amd64 --flavour generic > ~/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/patch-list.txt
canonical-livepatch-downloader get-files -i ~/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/patch-list.txt --keep-tarball
```

The output will indicate the download progress and display the final download location of the patch tarballs and extracted patches:

```
8/8 patches downloaded successfully.
Patches downloaded and extracted to /home/prinson/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/patches
Patch tarballs saved to /home/prinson/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/tarballs
```

### Removing downloaded patches

Because patches are downloaded to `~/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/patches` to remove all downloads simply run

```
rm -r ~/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/patches/*
```

To also remove any saved patch tarballs, run:

```
rm -r ~/snap/canonical-livepatch-downloader/common/tarballs
```

### Removing the Downloader

When removing the tool, Snap [snapshots](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapshots) may result in the removal taking a long time because a backup of the downloaded patches are being made. To avoid this, uninstall the tool with the following command to skip the creation of a snapshot.

```
sudo snap remove canonical-livepatch-downloader --purge
```
