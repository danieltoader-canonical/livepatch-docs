# Chain on-premises servers

As a Livepatch deployment grows, scaling out beyond a single deployment may be desirable.
This how-to document describes how to chain multiple Livepatch on-premises servers together.

This is useful in a few scenarios:

- Running the server in multiple availability zones or regions.
- Isolating machines to a specific on-premises instance.
- Increasing the scale of a deployment without HA.

To chain on-premises servers, the following are needed:

- An existing Livepatch on-premises server.
- A new deployment of the Livepatch on-premises server.
- The Livepatch admin tool [set up](/server/how-to-guides/security/setup-administration-tool.md) against the existing server.

When deploying an instance of the Livepatch Server (see the existing [guides](/server/how-to-guides/index.md)), an Ubuntu Pro token is normally used to configure the on-premises server to sync with Canonical's hosted Livepatch Server.

In this scenario, skip that step and use a token provided by the existing Livepatch Server.

Below, the "upstream" server is referred to as the original Livepatch Server and the "downstream" server as the new deployment that will sync from the "upstream".

## On the upstream server

Using the admin tool:

```
livepatch-admin sync-tokens add edge my-token
```

This will return a token that another on-premises server can use to sync patches.
Sync tokens, by default, do not expire but the `--valid-until` flag can be used to set an expiry date.

Change `edge` if syncing from a different tier is desired.

```{note}

See the [reference doc](/server/reference/patch-management/patch-management.md) to better understand how tiers work and how patches are synced.

```

## On the downstream server

Configure the following values on the charm or snap deployment:

- Set `patch-sync.token` using the previously obtained token.
- Set `patch-sync.upstream-url` to the upstream server URL.

The downstream Livepatch Server is now configured to sync from the upstream server.
This process can be repeated as many times as desired.

## Sync tiers (optional)

Conventionally, each Livepatch on-premises server provides its own patch management using local tiers.
Patches can be promoted between tiers to provide phased rollouts.

To cater for scenarios where patch management should only be done in one place and synced to various downstream servers, the ability to sync tiers is offered.

Enabling this feature will do the following:

- Match a server's tier structure to its upstream. This is a **destructive** operation and will remove any tiers that currently exist.

- Sync patch tier info from the upstream server. A patch, for example, 100.1 promoted to the "stable" tier upstream will automatically be reflected in the downstream server.

- Disable local patch management, that is, patches cannot be promoted between tiers and tiers cannot be created or destroyed through the admin tool.

This feature only needs to be enabled on the downstream server. No changes are needed on the upstream server.

Enable this functionality by setting the `patch-sync.sync-tiers` config value to `true`.
