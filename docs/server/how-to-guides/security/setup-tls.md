# How to setup TLS for Livepatch on-prem

The security of livepatching depends not only on the signed kernel modules but also on the secure TLS channel between the livepatch client and the on-prem server. It is thus paramount to setup the necessary TLS keys and certificates for the on-prem service to provide the necessary security.

There are several ways to set up TLS for livepatch on-prem. One way is to use a dedicated TLS terminating reverse proxy in front of the haproxy service. Another way is to configure the appropriate TLS certificate and key on the haproxy instance directly.

## Configuring TLS for haproxy

These are the steps to configure TLS on the haproxy service directly:

1.Create a `tls-overlay.yaml` file with the following content:

```
applications:
  haproxy:
    options:
      services: |
        - service_name: livepatch
          service_host: "0.0.0.0"
          service_port: 443
          service_options:
            - balance leastconn
            - cookie SRVNAME insert
            - 'acl restricted_api path_beg,url_dec -i /api/auth-tokens'
            - http-request deny if restricted_api
          server_options: maxconn 200 cookie S{i} check
          crts: [DEFAULT]
      ssl_cert: include-base64://./cert.pem
      ssl_key: include-base64://./key.pem
```

2. Rename the certificate and key files to `cert.pem` and `key.pem` and place them in the same directory as the downloaded overlay file.
3. Run the following juju command

```
juju deploy ch:canonical-livepatch-onprem --overlay ./tls-overlay.yaml
```

4. Run `juju status` to verify that the haproxy service is now exposing port 443

## Configuring livepatch admin tool with TLS

If the TLS certificate used for livepatch originates from a trusted CA, there should be no further configuration necessary - the livepatch admin tool will use the configured system certificates to verify the server's responses.

If, however, a self-signed certificate is used, the administration tool will need to be configured to use the certificate. There are several ways to do that.

### Command line option

The command line option for the livepatch admin tool accepts either the path to a certificate chain PEM file, or the contents of the certificate chain:

```
livepatch-admin --ca ./cert.pem login -a (...)
```

```
livepatch-admin --ca "$(cat ./cert.pem)" login -a (...)
```

### Environment variable

The environment variable `LIVEPATCH_CA_CRT` can be set with either the path to a certificate chain file or the contents of the certificate chain:

```
export LIVEPATCH_CA_CRT='/temp/cert.pem'
```

```
export LIVEPATCH_CA_CRT="$(cat ./cert.pem)"
```

## Configuring livepatch client with TLS

If a self-signed certificate is used for the livepatch on-prem service, livepatch client instances will also need to be configured with that certificate to be able to verify responses coming from the on-prem server:

```
sudo canonical-livepatch config ca-certs=@stdin < ./cert.pem
```
