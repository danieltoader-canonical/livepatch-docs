# Set up the Livepatch on-premises server administration tool

To perform operations such as promoting patches to tiers and issuing tokens for machines to attach to the Livepatch Server, an administration tool is provided as a snap:

```
sudo snap install canonical-livepatch-server-admin
```

For ease of use, alias the admin command:

```
sudo snap alias canonical-livepatch-server-admin.livepatch-admin livepatch-admin
```

## Authentication

The Livepatch administration tool can authenticate with the Livepatch Server in two ways:

* Ubuntu SSO
* Username and password

(server-how-to-guides-password-authentication)=

## Password authentication

To configure password authentication, username and password hash pairs must be generated using the `htpasswd` tool available in the `apache2-utils` package.

````{note}
The `apache2-utils` package can be installed using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```
````

Generate a username and password hash pair:

```
htpasswd -bnBC 10 <username> <password>
username:$2y$10$74ZpDgHaxnUQo.AJZk1cMuSRfef5oK5xq5o/GLbUH/Bbw6W2bmctm
```

Multiple pairs can be provided as a comma-separated list:

```
juju config livepatch auth_basic_users="<user1>:<password1,<user2>:<password2>"
```

When logging in with the client, provide the username and password:

```
export LIVEPATCH_URL={haproxy URL or unit IP}

livepatch-admin login --auth <username>:<password>
```

## Ubuntu SSO authentication

Ubuntu SSO authentication uses membership in public Launchpad groups to gate access. The Launchpad groups that have administrator privileges are specified using charmed operator configuration:

```
juju config livepatch auth_lp_teams='https://launchpad.net/~<team>'
```

Multiple teams can be specified as a comma-separated list.

When logging in, user interaction is required:

```
export LIVEPATCH_URL={haproxy URL}

livepatch-admin login
