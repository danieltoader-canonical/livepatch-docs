# Reporting bugs

Please file bugs at [the canonical-livepatch launchpad project](https://bugs.launchpad.net/canonical-livepatch-client/+filebug). When you open a bug, please provide the output from the following commands, so that we can troubleshoot your issue:

- `snap info canonical-livepatch`
- `canonical-livepatch status`
- `lsb_release -a`
- `uname -a`
- `journalctl -u snap.canonical-livepatch.canonical-livepatchd`

The output of `journalctl` can be long, so consider piping the output into `tail -100` to only show recent issues.

**Note:** We recommend marking the bug as private if any of the output contains personal information that you do not want publicly available and searchable.
