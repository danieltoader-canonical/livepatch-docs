# What kind of updates will be provided by the Ubuntu Livepatch Service?

The Livepatch Service intends to address high and critical severity Linux kernel security vulnerabilities, as identified by [Ubuntu Security Notices](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices) and the [CVE tracker](https://ubuntu.com/security/cve). Since there are limitations to the [kernel livepatch technology](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/livepatch/livepatch.rst), some Linux kernel code paths cannot be safely patched while running. There may be occasions when the traditional kernel upgrade and reboot might still be necessary.

Livepatches are developed and released based on kernel SRU releases, and contain a subset of the CVEs fixed by that kernel SRU. Livepatches are cumulative, so when a new livepatch is released, it contains both the new CVE fixes, as well as all of the CVE fixes from the previous release of that livepatch.
