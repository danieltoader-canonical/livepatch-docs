# When should I expect new updates??

Livepatches are related to and are ''usually'' derived from, but are not the same as, the kernel SRU updates for CVEs. While the vulnerabilities being addressed by both kernel SRU updates and livepatches are the same, the process for development and testing are not. A livepatch for a vulnerability can be significantly more complex than an ordinary kernel patch, and due to the additional complexity, can take more time to develop and test.

Canonical is committed to livepatching every high or critical rated CVE possible as quickly as we can, and in ideal circumstances, a livepatch will be available at the same time as the corresponding kernel SRU update.

If we determine that we cannot livepatch a high or critical CVE, we will inform our livepatch users at the same time an SRU kernel update that does fix the issue becomes available, in two ways:

- The livepatch client will indicate that the system must be rebooted by reporting a state of "reboot required." This will be accompanied by a notification in the desktop, on desktop systems, and a notification in the MOTD on the terminal.
- A LSN will be released containing instructions to reboot into a new SRU kernel that contains a fix for the CVE. LSNs are released on both the security website and via email.
