# What are Livepatch tiers?

Livepatch delivers patches to “tiers”. A tier is a target audience for the delivery of a patch. Your tier depends on whether you have a free or paid subscription to [Ubuntu Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro). The differences are outlined below.

| Tier | Description |
| :--- | :---: |
| Proposed | The initial tier where patches are added before they are promoted to the next tiers. |
| Internal | For internal Canonical use. Updates are first tested then applied across Canonical infrastructure to decrease the odds of a faulty patch making it to customer machines. |
| Updates | For free users of Ubuntu Pro. Patches are delivered to these machines next. |
| Stable | For paid users of Ubuntu Pro. Patches are delivered to these machines last. |

Our kernel team closely monitors the patch health within internal before promoting to updates and further monitoring is done before promoting the patch to stable.

For finer-grained control over patch roll-out take a look at [Livepatch On-Prem](/server/index.md).
