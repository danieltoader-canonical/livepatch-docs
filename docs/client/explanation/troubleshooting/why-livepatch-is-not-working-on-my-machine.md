# Why isn’t Livepatch working on my machine??

## UNSUPPORTED KERNELS

Livepatch supports only kernels that have been released by the kernel team to the updates pocket, i.e. officially-released kernels acquired through APT using Canonical's repository for system updates, or Snap-based kernels released by Canonical to stable Snap channels.

While a livepatch *might* successfully apply to a kernel acquired from other sources, only certain kernels released by Canonical are supported. Kernels from other sources are not supported, including but not limited to:

- kernels acquired from the development (proposed) kernel PPA
- kernels acquired from the kernel team's build PPA
- test kernels acquired from the kernel team's development PPAs
- personally-rebuilt kernels using the source debian package
- personally-rebuilt kernels using snapcraft
- kernels acquired from a Ubuntu-derived distribution

Please be aware that while it may be possible to build a kernel with the same version markings as an officially-supported kernel, and to attempt to load a Canonical-generated livepatch into that kernel, it will likely not work, and can potentially crash your system or corrupt your data.

Also note that a kernel running unsigned, out-of-tree drivers will be tainted, and the kernel will refuse to apply livepatches in this state.

A full list of supported kernels is available [here](/client/reference/platform/supported-kernels.md).

## HWE vs GA Kernels

Related to the above, detailing certain scenarios when a kernel may not be supported, it felt necessary to add a dedicated section on HWE (hardware enablement) versus GA (general availability) kernels.

Existing [blog posts](https://canonical.com/blog/canonical-livepatch-gets-even-better-now-supporting-hardware-enablement-kernels) and [official pages](https://ubuntu.com/kernel/variants) detail what exactly an HWE kernel is. Newer releases of LTS Ubuntu Desktop default to the HWE kernel, meaning your machine will be running a kernel version that will update alongside each Ubuntu release before settling on the kernel released alongside the next LTS. Ubuntu Server installs continue to remain on the GA kernel.

While Livepatch supports the GA kernel and the HWE that you eventually settle on alongside the next LTS, it does not completely support the interim kernels that are released every 6 months. This is why you might see your machine running an LTS Ubuntu Desktop release, but still encounter Livepatch messaging saying your kernel is not supported.

It is possible to switch from an HWE kernel to the GA if desired by following the instructions [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack). One should take care to backup data and other important information before making such system level changes.

Finally, while prior to Ubuntu 22.04, Livepatch offered no support for interim kernel versions, recently Livepatch has grown support for some flavours of interim HWE kernels as described in our [blog post](https://ubuntu.com/blog/canonical-livepatch-gets-even-better-now-supporting-hardware-enablement-kernels). Kernels for desktop users are the "generic" flavour, while kernels for public clouds have their own unique flavours, supporting cloud specific functionality. Livepatch is now supported on interim HWE kernels for various public cloud flavours. Check your kernel flavour with `uname -r`.

As above, a full list of GA and HWE kernels supported is available [here](/client/reference/platform/supported-kernels.md)

## SECUREBOOT

If you are using secure boot with a kernel older than April 1 2021, you will also need to import the livepatch public keys into your keyring. If your kernel is newer, there is no need to import keys as the key is included in the kernel, but doing so will not cause any harm.

Use the following command to import the livepatch key:

```

sudo mokutil --import /snap/canonical-livepatch/current/keys/livepatch-kmod.x509

```

After this enter a password if necessary for MOK, then reboot.

Your BIOS will then guide you through enrolling a new key in MOK. At this point you will be able to verify the module signatures.
