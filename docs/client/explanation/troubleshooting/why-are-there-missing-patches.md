# Why was there no livepatch for some particular high or critical CVE?

Livepatches are only produced for [supported kernels](/client/reference/platform/supported-kernels.md), and only for CVEs that require a Linux kernel modification to fix the problem (for example, a CPU bug may not have a kernel fix). Further, livepatches do not address security problems in Ubuntu software packages, or in third-party drivers that do not ship as part of the Linux kernel (i.e. NVIDIA GPU drivers).

Livepatch is intended to provide protection from security issues in *addition* to regular kernel security updates, so be sure to read and follow the security advisories published in Ubuntu Security Notifications ([USNs](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices)) for your kernel.
