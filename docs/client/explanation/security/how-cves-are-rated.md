# How do you rate a CVE?

We do not use an external rating system, but rate based on these qualifications:

| | |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *negligible* | Something that is technically a security problem, but is only theoretical in nature, requires a very special situation, has almost no install base, or does no real damage. These tend not to get backport from upstreams, and will likely not be included in security updates unless there is an easy fix and some other issue causes an update.|
| *low* | Something that is a security problem, but is hard to exploit due to environment, requires a user-assisted attack, a small install base, or does very little damage. These tend to be included in security updates only when higher priority issues require an update, or if many low priority issues have built up.|
| *medium* | Something is a real security problem, and is exploitable for many people. Includes network daemon denial of service attacks, cross-site scripting, and gaining user privileges. Updates should be made soon for this priority of issue.|
| *high* | A real problem, exploitable for many people in a default installation. Includes serious remote denial of services, local root privilege escalations, or data loss.|
| *critical* | A world-burning problem, exploitable for nearly all people in a default installation of Ubuntu. Includes remote root privilege escalations, or massive data loss.|
