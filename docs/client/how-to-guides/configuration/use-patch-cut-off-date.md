# How to use a patch cut-off date

See the [explanation](/client/explanation/troubleshooting/what-is-patch-cut-off-date.md) to understand the patch cut-off date feature.

## Check the cut-off date

To check the cut-off date, run the following command:

```bash
sudo canonical-livepatch config cutoff-date --format yaml
cutoff-date: "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z"

sudo canonical-livepatch config cutoff-date --format json
{"cutoff-date": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
```

## Enable or disable the cut-off date

To enable the cut-off date, run the following command:

```bash
sudo canonical-livepatch config cutoff-date="2024-10-01T12:00:00Z"
```

The argument to `cutoff-date` must be in RFC3339 format. Only times in the past can be set as the cut-off date.

To disable the cut-off date, run the following command:

```bash
sudo canonical-livepatch config cutoff-date=""
```
