# How to configure a proxy in the Livepatch client

Livepatch client users have the option to communicate with the Livepatch server through a proxy. Livepatch supports communicating through HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5 proxies. To do so, there are a few configuration parameters that should be assigned.

## Check proxy configuration

To check the proxy configuration of the Livepatch client, run the following command:

```bash
canonical-livepatch config
http-proxy: "http://proxy.example.com"
https-proxy: "http://proxy.example.com"
no-proxy: ""
ca-certs: ""
...
```

Note that an empty string value (“”) means the corresponding parameter is not set and system defaults will be used.

## Using an HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy

To enable the usage of an HTTP proxy, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo canonical-livepatch config http-proxy=http://proxy.example.com
sudo canonical-livepatch config https-proxy=http://proxy.example.com
```

Users can also configure the Livepatch client to use a SOCKS5 proxy by running these commands:

```bash
sudo canonical-livepatch config http-proxy=socks5://proxy.example.com:1080
sudo canonical-livepatch config https-proxy=socks5://proxy.example.com:1080
```

Although the client respects the standard Linux environment variables used for proxy setup (i.e., `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` or `NO_PROXY`), please note that for them to take effect, they should be set in the Livepatch client daemon process environment. Therefore, it is more straightforward for users to use the above configuration parameters.

## Using an HTTPS proxy

When using an HTTPS proxy (not to be confused with proxying HTTPS requests), users need to make sure they are including `https://` scheme when setting the above configuration parameters:

```bash
sudo canonical-livepatch config http-proxy=https://proxy.example.com
sudo canonical-livepatch config https-proxy=https://proxy.example.com
```

If a self-signed CA certificate is included in the HTTPS proxy’s TLS certificate chain, the user should add the CA certificate to the trusted certificates on the host machine by running the following commands (assuming `ca.crt` is the CA certificate file):

```bash
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
sudo cp ca.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates
sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates
```

However, if a user does not want to install a self-signed CA certificate as a system-wide trusted one, they can explicitly instruct Livepatch client to trust the CA certificate:

```bash
sudo canonical-livepatch config ca-certs=@stdin < ca.crt
```

## Routing directly to Livepatch server

If there is already a system-wide proxy set up (e.g., by `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable), the users can escape it for communication with the Livepatch server by using the following configuration:

```bash
sudo canonical-livepatch config no-proxy=canonical.com
```
