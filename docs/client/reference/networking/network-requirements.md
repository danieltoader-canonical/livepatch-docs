# Livepatch client firewall configuration

On firewalled machines, `canonical-livepatch` needs access to two hostnames:

- `livepatch.canonical.com`, port 443
- `livepatch-files.canonical.com`, port 443

If livepatch client is enabled using Ubuntu Pro, additional access to `contracts.canonical.com` on port 443 will be required.

For snap installation, see [snap network requirements](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/network-requirements/5147).

**Note:** Previously patches were served via HTTP until switching over to HTTPS in ~Oct 2023.
