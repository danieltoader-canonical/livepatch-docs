# Data sent to Canonical

Livepatch client instances ping servers hosted by Canonical at a configurable schedule (every hour by default) to check for the availability of new patches. These requests contain the following information:

- system architecture
- CPU model
- kernel version
- boot time and uptime
- unique machine identifier, based on `/etc/machine-id`
- version of the currently applied livepatch (if any)
- current state of the system (whether a livepatch has been applied or not)
- time of the last server request
- version of the client
