# What is patch cut-off date?

*Patch cut-off date* is a feature that allows you to set a time in the past, after which no patches will be applied to the system. This is useful for ensuring that the state of the system is deterministic and reproducible. It guarantees that no changes will be made after a certain date.

The use of patch cut-off date is recommended only for groups of systems that require a high level of uniformity, and synchronized updates. Delaying the application of high and critical security patches leaves the exploit window of a known vulnerability open, until the patch is applied.

## Availability

This feature is available only for users with a paid Ubuntu Pro subscription, or to public cloud customers running Ubuntu Pro images, which retrieve Livepatch patches from Canonical's hosted Livepatch service. This feature is not available for self-hosted Livepatch servers.

Livepatch Client version 10.11.2 or greater is required.

## Excluded CVE fixes

Starting from Livepatch Client version 10.15.0, the verbose output will contain a warning message if the cut-off date blocked the latest patch. This message will contain the CVEs the machine is no longer protected against, along with the related LSN and LSN publish timestamp.

An example of running `canonical-livepatch status –verbose` with an older patch:

```
[!] KERNEL PATCHES BLOCKED: SECURITY RISK DETECTED
The latest patches for your kernel have been blocked by current configuration.
An older patch has been installed instead.
Run "canonical-livepatch config" and review the values for cutoff-date to check if they are still relevant.

## What if I already have a patch applied?

If you already have a patch applied and its release date is after the cut-off date to fully remove the changes from your system, you will need to reboot the machine.

If you set a cut-off date and the release date of the patch is before the cut-off date, you are not required to take any action. The patch will remain applied.
