# Resource requirements

The resource requirements for machines running livepatch on-prem components (postgresql, haproxy, livepatch) depend on the amount of machines being serviced by the deployment.

Minimal requirements are:

|Service|Memory|CPUs|Disk|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|postgresql|4GB|1|50GB|
|haproxy|2GB|1|50GB|
|livepatch|2GB|1|50GB|

If postgresql is going to be used as the patchstore, we recommend increasing disk allocated to postgresql to 100GB.

The bundle needs to be deployed on machines running Ubuntu focal.
